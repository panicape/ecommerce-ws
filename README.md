#E-Commerce Repository for interview

This repository is focused on a definition of a small RESTFUL APIS project of an E-Commerce Platform

It is segmented in 3 parts:

- Repository: There are 2 packages:
-   persistence: each handles CRUD requests to the DB
-   model: It has the entity maps of each table

- Restful apis: It includes the RESTFUL api to enable an interface to process the needed queries
- SQL scripts: It includes a schema.sql that creates the schema and tables needed and init_schema.sql to include the needed data.


On the other hand, there are 2 test classes, one of them includes the test of the repositories request and the other one includes the RESTFUL API tests
